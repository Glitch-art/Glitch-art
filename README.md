### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Systems Engineer with a solid foundation in software development and design, committed to agile practices and with a continuous focus on ensuring the quality and robust architecture of the solutions I design.
Beyond my technical skills, I am currently studying a specialization in Management for Organizational Development, which complements my activity planning and leadership skills, making it ideal for environments where coordination and strategy play an essential role.

## Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- A web page to facilitate the use of inventories made with ruby on rails.
- A sudoku app for SmartWatch (WearOs).

## Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on OpenSource projects.
